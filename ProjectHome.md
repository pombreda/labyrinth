## 2012/11/02 ➠ 0.6 ##

I'm pleased to announce the release of Labyrinth 0.6. This is primarily a bugfix release, but involved fairly major changes to the codebase. All users are encouraged to upgrade.

Highlights:

  * Zooming in and out, which was a source of frustration for many, has been greatly improved.
  * Editing rich text inside thoughts is now more stable.
  * Maps are now stored in the application data directory, as specified by Freedesktop.org. Existing maps will be automatically moved when you run the new version.
  * The autotools build system is no longer used, so it's simpler to install and hack the codebase.

You can download the new release [from Github](https://github.com/labyrinth-team/labyrinth/zipball/0.6), and run 'python labyrinth' to use it. The package has also been submitted to Ubuntu.

If you encounter any bugs, please report them [on Github](https://github.com/labyrinth-team/labyrinth/issues).
