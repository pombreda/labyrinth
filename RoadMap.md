# Roadmap for 0.5.0 #

## Goals ##

  * [Open issues for this release.](http://code.google.com/p/labyrinth/issues/list?q=label:release0.5)
  * all of [the listed ideas](Ideas.md)?

## Schedule ##

We should have something like a schedule, so we can better focus on feature implementation, translation and bug fixing. However, it is not clear for when to set a deadline.

| **Date** | **Status** | **Notes** |
|:---------|:-----------|:----------|
| 08/09/01 | Feature Freeze | No more features, just bug fixing |
| 08/09/24 | String Freeze | No more changes to the internationalizable strings |
| 08/10/01 | Release |  |

Schedule as [ical](http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/iqu1fjojo7ae9eqtpr996c21jk%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics).
